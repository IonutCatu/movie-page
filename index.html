  <h1>Vinland Saga</h1>
  <img src="vinland-saga.jpg" alt="vinland-saga">
  <p>Fifteen years ago the Viking commander, Thors Snorresson, deserted a sea battle and commenced a peaceful life in Iceland with his wife Helga. Now, in the year 1002, their young son, Thorfinn, longs to see the paradise called Vinland. One day,
    the Jomsviking Floki arrives at Thorfinn's village to enlist Thors into battle, who is revealed to be a former Jomsviking himself. However, Floki's true motive is to murder Thors as punishment for deserting fifteen years prior. Thorfinn sneaks on
    his father's ship despite his orders to remain home, and the ship is eventually lured into a trap at the Faroe Islands and ambushed by a band of mercenaries led by Askeladd, with whom Floki had conspired to kill Thors. With his great strength and
    skill, Thors at first fights off the attackers even without using deadly force but submits to execution after Thorfinn is taken, hostage. After his father's death, Thorfinn joins Askeladd's crew to avenge his father and constantly challenges his
    commander to various duels. By 1013, Askeladd's company find employment as mercenaries in the Danish invasion of London under Thorkell the Tall.</p>
